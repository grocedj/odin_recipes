    <h1>Cruchy Chicken</h1>
    <p>This is one of my favorite recipes. I got it out of a cook book from one of my favoite rappers. 
        This recipe is somethings that my girlfriend and I like to throw together whenever
        we have a little bit of time but don't want to put too much effort into
        cooking. It's pretty quick once you get the hang of the ratios. Honestly, we
        don't even measure the ingredients out anymore, so this is more of a jumping point for 
        you to start at.
